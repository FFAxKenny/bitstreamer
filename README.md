Bitstreamer
----------------

Bitstreamer is a simple python based protocol translator for dealing with serial devices.
Useful if you're being bogged down by sending ASCII data, and you need to 
squeeze some more performance out of your serial device. 

It features an easy to use interface, with flags for debug operation and logging at 
the module layer. 

Note: it is currently __not__ in a usable state. More updates to come soon!
